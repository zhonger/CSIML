Figures
#######

We can use SIML to plot many figures so as to dive more deeply into materials dataset and results. It mainly includes:

* Distribution in periodic table
* Distribution in existed elements
* Distribution in different levels
* Distribution of errors in different levels
* Comparison between predicted and experimental values and distribution of predicted values
